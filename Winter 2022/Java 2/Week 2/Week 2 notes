Objects are an instance of a class

Methods are generally instances unless they are defined as static (such as Math.random())

Static variables are available by all instances of the class

to use static variable in need to be invokled by a static method

You can separate it into 3 zones Class scope, public scope, package scope

it is mandatory to make all datafields private. Otherwise, abstraction and encapsulation is not observed.

For a class to be immutable, it must mark all data fields private 
and provide no mutator methods and no accessor methods that 
would return a reference to a mutable data field object.
