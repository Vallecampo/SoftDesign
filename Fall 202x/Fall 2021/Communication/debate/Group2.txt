Rebuttals

- (Based on initial premise) Considering time skip - there is no easing into the future
- Global warming data shows you would walk into extreme climate with no way to prepare
- Good points, public speaking lacks a bit but can power through amazingly
- Some things will not keep up as much as other sectors and change the religious plane of society
- on time

Last Round

- work together well but not enough (human perserverance)
- people already have trouble so how could one adapt even if available (Would tecnology not be available to everyone?)
- Will never really go away but will definitely change (Will religion really disappear?)
- Ressources are lacking, of course we would fight (Why assume it's warring states?)
